      <u><b>What is Chess:</b></u> Chess is a board game of strategic skill for two players, played on 
a checkered board. Each player begins the game with sixteen pieces that are moved 
and used to capture opposing pieces according to precise rules. The object is to put the 
opponent's king under a direct attack from which escape is impossible (checkmate).
    </p>
    <p>
    <u><b>What is the purpose of Chess:</b></u> The primary objective of Chess is <b>to capture your opponent's King while keeping your 
own well-guarded</b>. When your King is trapped and cannot avoid capture, your opponent 
calls “checkmate” and the game is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
    <u><b>Who created Chess:</b></u> Chess was invented in <b>India around the 8th century</b>.
Then it was known as chatrang, and changed over the centuries by the Arabs, Persians 
and then ultimately the medieval Europeans, who changed the pieces' names and 
appearances to resemble the English court.
    </p>
    <p>
    <u><b>Is Chess a war game:</b></u>  From ancient India to the computer age, <b>the 
military has used chess as both a metaphor and even as training for warfare</b>. ... 
Yet chess began in 6th Century India as a 64-square board game, called Chaturanga,
precisely modelled on the military forces of the day. There were "elephants", "chariots" 
and "'infantrymen"
